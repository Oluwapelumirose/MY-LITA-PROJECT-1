### Project Overview 
A sales performance analysis typically aims to evealuate and understand key sales trends, identify top-performing products and pinpoint areas for improvement. Here's an overview to guide through structuring a sales performance analysis project;

### Objective
To assess the store's sales performance to inform better business decisions
To identify top-performing products, peak sales periods, and underperforming areas
To analyze customer buying patterns, and regional trends on sales.
Data Collection The main data sources for this analysis is the "Data Sales" file, which are open-source datasets available

### Tools Used

- Excel: for data cleaning and visualization
- SQL: Utilized for data cleaning through queries
- PowerBI: Used for both data cleaning and visualization
- Data Cleaning and Preparations In the initial phase of Data Cleaning and Preparations, we perform the following actions;
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing variables
- Data Cleaning and Formatting
  
1. Excel: This is a popular spreadsheet software developed by Microsoft.
### Steps taken in excel
1. Load the data
2. Cleaned the data
3. Removed duplicate
4. Created pivot table for different visualisation needs
5. createÂ report

Customers Data

### Calculations in Both Dataset
- Total Sales =   Quantity * Unit price
- Average Total Sales = Total Sales/Quantity
- Overall Total Sales =sum of total sale in each region
- Average sales per product = overall total sales/Total quantity

  
2. SQL: To query and retrieve specific data.

   ```
   CREATE database LITA_Capstone_Project_1
   SELECT * from [dbo].[LITA_Capstone_Project_1]
   ```

Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions;

- retrieve the total sales for each product category
  
   ```
   SELECT Product,
   SUM(revenue) AS TotalSales
   FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone SalesData]
   GROUP BY Product;
   ```
